Initialize a variable i with the value 60 :
- Write a while loop:
- The loop should run as long as the value of i is less than or equal to 70.
- Inside the loop, log the message "ok it's good " followed by the current value of i to the console.
- Increment the value of i by 1 in each iteration.
- Output the results:
- The console should display the message for each value of i from 60 to 70.

## [exercice] Exercise 7
Initialize a variable i with the value 60.
- Write a for loop:
- The loop should start with i = 60 and decrement i in each iteration.
- The loop should run as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.
- Inside the loop, log the message "ok it's good " followed by the current value of i to the console.

## [exercice] Exercise 8
Declare three string variables:

- Print the ASCII code of each character to the console using console.log.
## [info] Info

       "a" is 97.
       "E" is 69.
